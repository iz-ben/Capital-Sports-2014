The code is really really old and there is a high probability that the Google Closure Library methods 
and classes are obsolete for example the html dom class managers, 
therefore it may not be possible to compile with no errors without rewriting them

Just to clarify, I have no intention to update this in the future, but it is a great example on how to write and annotate code.

The [AudioManager](https://github.com/iz-ben/AudioManager) is more current and better written. I was pretty new to javascript with Capital Sports
